Prerequisites :

Make sure you have newer pip and python3:

Python version: 3.5-3.8 (Linux), 3.6-3.7 (ARM), 3.8 (OSX), 3.8-64bit (Windows)
pip version: 19.0 and newer.


Uprade python and pip if needed. Then install vosk on Linux/Mac with a simple command

pip3 install vosk


Also please note that Vosk requires libgfortran on some Linux builds which might be missing, you might need to install libgfortran with a package manager.

On Windows make sure you have 64-bit Python. We do not support 32-bit python yet.

In case of trouble installing, verify and provide for analysis the output of the following commands

python3 --version
pip3 --version
pip3 -v install vosk
